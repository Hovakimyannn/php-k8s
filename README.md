Control your Kubernetes clusters with this PHP-based Kubernetes client. It supports any form of authentication, the exec API, and it has an easy implementation for CRDs.

For Laravel projects, you might want to use [renoki-co/laravel-php-k8s](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-php-k8s) which eases the access for this particular case.
